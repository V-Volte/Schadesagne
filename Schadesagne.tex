\begin{stanza}
Of battles won and of lost wars I sing,\verseline
And of the fickle hands of tempted Fate;\verseline
Of he the king that tried to better all \vel
And yet was scorned by those he sought to love;\verseline
And of his golden haired and mighty heir\verseline
The friend of Dawn that won eternal fame.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Goddess of voice that flows like purest stream,\verseline
That didst inspire the first great poets and bards,\verseline
Lend me thy voice that I may clearly sing\verseline
Of glorious, mighty heroes past and brave\verseline
And how the gods from Heaven did descend\verseline
Upon this Earth and fight the wars of men.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
First of the isle of roses I shall sing\vel
Of golden sands and sapphire streams, where once\vel
Impregnable did raise the son of flame\vel
Five castles grand of stone with tow’rs so high\vel
The king of Heav’n himself them struck back down,\vel
Henmernis, star shaped isle on sky like sea,\vel
Guarded by Lydna, Psykonaurai East,\vel
And Spathotouros South where once the gods\vel
Of Heaven fought the spawn of Gogne giant\vel
And mighty Krastan blest by Pheos the fire\vel
Where once did make his seat and Throne; this isle\vel
With greenest grass, a verdant plain of beauty\vel
Unmatched, with calming skies that lulled to sleep\vel
Even a man by Sophne curs'd: This haven,\vel
Blest isle, so grand and rich, so beautiful\vel
Her men so joyous, pleased and prospering\vel
And blossoming with smiles all ‘round her coasts\vel
Too happy was to quench the dreadful thirst,\vel
And bound to tempt the fickle hand, of Fate.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Now poor and barren stood this island sad\vel
Which once did rival in her grandeur great\vel
The gleaming fields of Theses, Elynor\vel
Not was there to be seen a smile of joy\vel
Upon the faces of her folk nor happy\vel
Songs to be heard where once they were\vel
No strong young men did run across her streets\vel
Nor hand-in-hand fair maidens walked and laughed;
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Her centres where all men and women once\vel
Gathered to watch the plays of Leusene\vel
And Rhezelos and danced in joy when came\vel
The feast of Serne, rose-eyed queen of love,\vel
Deserted stood; for not was there a ware\vel
For foreign merchants to display and nor\vel
Would fein them buy a man in this poor land;\vel
Her lofty walls and sky-high towers built\vel
In ancient times by kings of fiery blood\vel
Now crumbled, shattered, fell and turned to ruin\vel
And not a coin was found to raise them back.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
The Royal Court that housed great Krastan's Throne\vel
Whence ruled such mighty kings as Lauchores\vel
And swift Alyxastros of two flames born;\vel
That once in grandeur and in pomp outshone\vel
The flowing wealth of Methres and of Eis;\vel
And softest velvet drapes whose walls adorned\vel
When still the famous Throne so brightly burnt,\vel
That Court as if the gods themelves had come\vel
down to this Earth and rebuilt Meros mount \vel
Once looked; those pristine walls whose golden glow\vel
Echoed the smiles of gods that ruled above,\vel
Now they reflected naught but Heaven's scorn,\vel
That Court of Kings now stood the beggar's court.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Th' Iseitan eagle gleaming black and proud\vel
and of Austrantia rampant argent mare,\vel
That once beside Henmernen lion stood\vel
as loyal allies on Imperian shore,\vel
Now led the fiery throne as mahout leads\vel
His tusked beast ahead though weaker far;\vel
The pompous vassal lords, ministers all\vel
Took to their rightful king but empty oaths:\vel
From neighbour's well as greedy farmer steals,\vel
Foreign kings from lands beyond with gold\vel
and Clesian riches bought their loyalties.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Say then what caused this fall from grace, O Muse,\vel
Celestial daughter, thou that knowest all,\vel
Of this, the isle of Melanos, once favoured\vel
Highly of Heav'nly gods and of the Fates\vel
That spin above the vast Chaotic sea\vel
Beside the house of Night their Fatal yarn,\vel
What caused such sorrow, and this darkest age,\vel
Sing of the past, thou Lady pleasant voiced,\vel
Of that first catalyst that started all,\vel
The force that brought these wretched times.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
When still the land of clever Melanos\vel
Enjoyed the favour of the Heav'nly host,\vel
There ruled a king of Krastan's blessed line,\vel
And as his father and as his before\vel
he ruled with kingly might and noble love,\vel
When those Henmernen farmers sowed their seeds,\vel
And left their fields, for rich and potent\vel
The land did raise the crop without their hand,\vel
And all the gods, celestial kings, were pleased\vel
by sacrifices of both meat and wheat:\vel
The star-shaped isle was envied all around,\vel
For kingdoms could but hope to equal her. 
\end{stanza}
%\begin{stanza} 
%There was a king that ruled an isle on sea,\verseline
%From Krastan’s Throne with wisdom great, and love\verseline
%He bore the men o’er whom he reigned, and yet\verseline
%Those men had naught for him but hate and scorn;\verseline
%Curséd he was, for words his father spoke\vel
%So long ago with joy and mirth: And those\vel
%Assertions of a happy future caused\vel
%the Fates to set on proving his hopes wrong.
%\end{stanza}
%\begin{stanza}
%This isle now cursed had not a drop of rain\vel
%That fell from Heav'n to feed and grow her plants;\vel
%Nor was there to be seen a happy smile\vel
%Upon the faces of her folk, and nor\vel
%A joyous song was sung; no maidens fair\vel
%did run across her streets with knowing laughs,\vel
%And lofty walls and sky-high towers built\vel
%in ancient times by kings of fiery blood\vel
%Now crumbled, shattered, fell and turned to ruin\vel
%And not a coin was found to raise them back.
%\end{stanza}
%\begin{stanza}
%The royal court that housed great Krastan's Throne\vel
%Was stripped of all the grandeur and the pomp\vel
%with which it was adorned in days of old;\vel
%Now plain and sad it stood with faded flags\vel
%And blackened walls; The king that sat upon\vel
%The fiery Throne who once was loved by all\vel
%Now sat there th' object of the ire and hate\vel
%of both th' immortal Fates and mortal men\vel
%And courtiers served him duty-bound alone\vel
%And bore their lord not respect and not love. 
%\end{stanza}
%\begin{stanza}
%That once was filled with grace and love for he\vel
%Who sat upon the Fiery throne; now noblemen\vel
%That poorer looked than poorest man abroad\vel
%Each day did gather in the court for they were\vel
%by duty bound to serve their King; yet none\vel
%of them did bear a semblance of
